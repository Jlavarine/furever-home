# Furever Home

Furever Home is a web application that helps users find their perfect dog match. Users can filter available dogs by breed and zip code, view detailed profiles of each dog, and favorite the ones they love the most. After favoriting, users can generate their "Perfect Match" â€” the dog most compatible with their selected favorites.

The application communicates with a backend API to fetch available dog profiles, filter by user-selected criteria, and retrieve additional data like location coordinates for each dog.
